MaDoggo was our final project at Le-Wagon Bootcamp.
MaDoggo allows you to find different dog parks in your area, chat with the people that are in the park, check in and out with your dogs, leave a review on each park and simply make your dog's life much happier whenn finding other dogs to play and run with.

<b>Please inspect and look with a mobile-view as the project is mobile-view only for now.</b>
